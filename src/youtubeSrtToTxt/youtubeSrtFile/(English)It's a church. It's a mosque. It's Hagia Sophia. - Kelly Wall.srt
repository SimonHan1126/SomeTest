1
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:10,752
They say that if walls could talk, each building would have a story to tell,

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,843
but few would tell so many fascinating stories in so many different voices

3
00:00:15,843 --> 00:00:19,384
as the Hagia Sophia, or holy wisdom.

4
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:21,815
Perched at the crossroads  of continents and cultures,

5
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:25,510
it has seen massive changes  from the name of the city where it stands,

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,990
to its own structure and purpose.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,692
And today, the elements from each era stand

8
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:34,011
ready to tell their tales  to any visitor who will listen.

9
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:38,403
Even before you arrive at the Hagia Sophia, the ancient fortifications

10
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:41,393
hint at the strategic importance  of the surrounding city,

11
00:00:41,393 --> 00:00:46,357
founded as Byzantium  by Greek colonists in 657 BCE.

12
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:50,811
And successfully renamed as  Augusta Antonia, New Rome and Constantinople

13
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:54,398
as it was conquered, reconquered, destroyed and rebuilt

14
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:59,740
by various Greek, Persian and  Roman rulers over the following centuries.

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,396
And it was within these walls that  the first Megale Ekklesia, or great church,

16
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:06,494
was built in the fourth century.

17
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:08,746
Though it was soon burned to the ground in riots,

18
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:11,822
it established the location for the region's main religious structure

19
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,963
for centuries to come.

20
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:16,470
Near the entrance, the marble stones with reliefs

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,127
are the last reminders  of the second church.

22
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:24,306
Built in 415 CE, it was destroyed  during the Nika Riots of 532

23
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:26,326
when angry crowds at a chariot race

24
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:29,593
nearly overthrew the emperor,  Justinian the First.

25
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:31,718
Having barely managed to retain power,

26
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:35,059
he resolved to rebuild the church on a grander scale,

27
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:39,819
and five years later, the edifice  you see before you was completed.

28
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,966
As you step inside, the stones  of the foundation and walls

29
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:46,573
murmur tales from their homelands of Egypt and Syria,

30
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:51,860
while columns taken from the Temple of Artemis recall a more ancient past.

31
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,226
Runic inscriptions carved by the  Vikings of the emperor's elite guard

32
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:57,641
carry the lore of distant northern lands.

33
00:01:57,641 --> 00:02:02,696
But your attention is caught by  the grand dome, representing the heavens.

34
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:06,954
Reaching over 50 meters high and  over 30 meters in diameter

35
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:09,589
and ringed by windows around its base,

36
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:12,348
the golden dome appears suspended from heaven,

37
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:15,013
light reflecting through its interior.

38
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:19,253
Beneath its grandiose symbolism, the sturdy reinforcing Corinthian columns,

39
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:22,914
brought from Lebanon after  the original dome was partially destroyed

40
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:25,651
by an earthquake in 558 CE,

41
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:27,691
quietly remind you of its fragility

42
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,278
and the engineering skills such a marvel requires.

43
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:34,337
If a picture is worth a thousand words,

44
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:37,416
the mosaics from the next several  centuries have the most to say

45
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,890
not only about their Biblical themes,

46
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,964
but also the Byzantine emperors who commissioned them,

47
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:45,438
often depicted along with Christ.

48
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:47,481
But beneath their loud and clear voices,

49
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:51,845
one hears the haunting echoes of  the damaged and missing mosaics and icons,

50
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:56,131
desecrated and looted during  the Latin Occupation in the Fourth Crusade.

51
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,933
Within the floor, the tomb inscription of Enrico Dandolo,

52
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,382
the Venetian ruler who  commanded the campaign,

53
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:08,109
is a stark reminder of those 57 years that Hagia Sophia spent as a Roman Catholic church

54
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:13,009
before returning to its orthodox roots upon the Byzantine Reconquest.

55
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,227
But it would not remain a church for long.

56
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:19,873
Weakened by the Crusades, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453

57
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:22,452
and would be known as Istanbul thereafter.

58
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,828
After allowing his soldiers three days of pillage,

59
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:27,474
Sultan Mehmed the Second  entered the building.

60
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:30,579
Though heavily damaged,  its grandeur was not lost

61
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,866
on the young sultan who immediately rededicated it to Allah,

62
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:37,326
proclaiming that it would be the new imperial mosque.

63
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,462
The four minarets built  over the next century

64
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:41,571
are the most obvious sign of this era,

65
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:45,669
serving as architectural supports  in addition to their religious purpose.

66
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:47,128
But there are many others.

67
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:50,750
Ornate candle holders relate  Suleiman's conquest of Hungary,

68
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,283
while giant caligraphy discs  hung from the ceiling

69
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:57,625
remind visitors for the first  four caliphs who followed Muhammad.

70
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:02,666
Though the building you see today still looks like a mosque, it is now a museum,

71
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,698
a decision made in 1935 by Kemal Ataturk,

72
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:08,798
the modernizing first president of Turkey

73
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:11,608
following the Ottoman Empire's collapse.

74
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:15,158
It was this secularization that allowed for removal

75
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,863
of the carpets hiding  the marble floor decorations

76
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:20,639
and the plaster covering  the Christian mosaics.

77
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,614
Ongoing restoration work  has allowed the multiplicity of voices

78
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,490
in Hagia Sophia's long history

79
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,336
to be heard again after centuries of silence.

80
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,071
But conflict remains.

81
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,471
Hidden mosaics cry out from  beneath Islamic calligraphy,

82
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:38,966
valuable pieces of history that cannot be uncovered without destroying others.

83
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:42,653
Meanwhile, calls sound from both Muslim and Christian communities

84
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:45,930
to return the building to  its former religious purposes.

85
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,203
The story of the divine wisdom  may be far from over,

86
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:52,624
but one can only hope that  the many voices residing there

87
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:55,704
will be able to tell their part for years to come.
