1
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:08,984
It was the dawn of 1863,

2
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:11,935
and London’s  not-yet-opened subway system,

3
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:16,184
the first of its kind in the world,  had the city in an uproar.

4
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:20,094
Digging a hole under the city  and putting a railroad in it

5
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:22,557
seemed the stuff of dreams.

6
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:24,755
Pub drinkers scoffed at the idea

7
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:29,625
and a local minister accused the railway company of trying to break into hell.

8
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,923
Most people simply thought the project,

9
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:35,425
which cost more than 100 million dollars in today’s money,

10
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:36,994
would never work.

11
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:38,732
But it did.

12
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,107
On January 10, 1863,

13
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:46,254
30,000 people ventured underground  to travel on the world’s first subway

14
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,654
on a four-mile stretch of line in London.

15
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:52,676
After three years of construction and a few setbacks,

16
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:56,197
the Metropolitan Railway  was ready for business.

17
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:58,605
The city’s officials were much relieved.

18
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:00,545
They’d been desperate to find a way

19
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:03,853
to reduce the terrible  congestion on the roads.

20
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:08,345
London, at the time the world’s largest  and most prosperous city,

21
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:10,826
was in a permanent state of gridlock,

22
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:11,685
with carts,

23
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:12,703
costermongers,

24
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:13,471
cows,

25
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:16,143
and commuters jamming the roads.

26
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:20,163
It’d been a Victorian visionary,  Charles Pearson,

27
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,335
who first thought of putting railways  under the ground.

28
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:26,932
He’d lobbied for underground trains  throughout the 1840s,

29
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:29,907
but opponents thought the idea was impractical

30
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:34,444
since the railroads at the time  only had short tunnels under hills.

31
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:37,754
How could you get a railway  through the center of a city?

32
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:42,033
The answer was a simple system  called "cut and cover."

33
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:44,625
Workers had to dig a huge trench,

34
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,354
construct a tunnel out of brick archways,

35
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:51,065
and then refill the hole  over the newly built tunnel.

36
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:52,584
Because this was disruptive

37
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:55,505
and required the demolition  of buildings above the tunnels,

38
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:58,473
most of the line went under existing roads.

39
00:01:58,473 --> 00:02:00,866
Of course, there were accidents.

40
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:04,840
On one occasion, a heavy rainstorm  flooded the nearby sewers

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,363
and burst through the excavation,

42
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:09,973
delaying the project by several months.

43
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:13,036
But as soon as  the Metropolitan Railway opened,

44
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:16,207
Londoners rushed in  to ride the new trains.

45
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:20,211
The Metropolitan quickly became  a vital part of London’s transport system.

46
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,424
Additional lines were soon built,

47
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:25,626
and new suburbs grew around the stations.

48
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:28,312
Big department stores opened  next to the railroad,

49
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:31,184
and the railway company  even created attractions,

50
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:37,275
like a 30-story Ferris wheel in Earls Court to bring in tourists by train.

51
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:38,624
Within 30 years,

52
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:41,415
London’s subway system covered  80 kilometers,

53
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:44,463
with lines in the center of town running in tunnels,

54
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:48,984
and suburban trains operating  on the surface, often on embankments.

55
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:50,840
But London was still growing,

56
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,814
and everyone wanted  to be connected to the system.

57
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:55,255
By the late 1880s,

58
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:59,736
the city had become too dense with buildings, sewers, and electric cables

59
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,905
for the "cut and cover" technique,

60
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:04,375
so a new system had to be devised.

61
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,324
Using a machine  called the Greathead Shield,

62
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:11,164
a team of just 12 workers could  bore through the earth,

63
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:15,075
carving deep underground tunnels  through the London clay.

64
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:19,156
These new lines, called tubes, were at varying depths,

65
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:23,326
but usually about 25 meters deeper than  the "cut and cover" lines.

66
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:26,436
This meant their construction  didn’t disturb the surface,

67
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:29,335
and it was possible  to dig under buildings.

68
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:32,494
The first tube line,  the City and South London,

69
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:36,054
opened in 1890 and proved so successful

70
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:40,033
that half a dozen more lines  were built in the next 20 years.

71
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:44,755
This clever new technology was even used  to burrow several lines

72
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:47,393
under London’s river, the Thames.

73
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,824
By the early 20th century,

74
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:50,536
Budapest,

75
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:51,257
Berlin,

76
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:51,995
Paris,

77
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:52,865
and New York

78
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,535
had all built subways of their own.

79
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,955
And today, with more than 160 cities  in 55 countries

80
00:03:59,955 --> 00:04:02,995
using underground rails  to combat congestion,

81
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:06,805
we can thank Charles Pearson and the Metropolitan Railway

82
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:09,094
for getting us started on the right track.
